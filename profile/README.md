**Spectral Cloud**, built with Entremonde Books, is the next-generation publishing engine, automating the editorial workflow end to end, from raw manuscripts to polished digital releases and beautifully printed books.

The software suite converts Word documents into clean, publication-ready manuscripts, makes bibliography management simple through a flexible and customizable Zotero interface, and lets you export a book either as an EPUB file or as a fully automated InDesign layout generated from templates.
