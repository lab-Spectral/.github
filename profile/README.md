### Automated Editorial Workflow
Developed with Entremonde Books, this next-generation publishing engine automates the editorial process end to end, from raw manuscripts to polished digital releases and beautifully printed books.

The suite converts Word documents into clean, publication-ready manuscripts, simplifies bibliography management through a flexible and customizable Zotero interface, and enables exporting either as EPUB files or as fully automated InDesign layouts generated from templates for print.
